# Installation

Prvd 'M Wrong is distributed as several packages, which you will need to install
into your game. For Luau, either use a pre-built Roblox model, download from
Wally, or download from Pesde. For TypeScript, use the NPM package. Otherwise,
download from source.

## From Templates

Prvd 'M Wrong has batteries-included templates for both Luau and Roblox
TypeScript under the `@prvdmwrong/templates` repository.

1. On the web, head over to the [`prvdmwrong/templates`
    repository.](https://github.com/prvdmwrong/templates) and click the "Code"
    dropdown, then click "Download ZIP". Inside is a copy of the templates
    repository:

    ![Download ZIP](../assets/static/github-download-zip.png)

      Alternatively, in a terminal, run the following command:

      ```Bash
      git clone https://github.com/prvdmwrong/templates.git
      cd templates
      ```

2. Use one of the following templates inside the repository:
      - For Luau projects:

        - Use the [`luau-barebones` template](https://github.com/prvdmwrong/templates/tree/main/luau-barebones)
          for a pre-configured barebones prelude.

        - Use the [`luau-comprehensive` template](https://github.com/prvdmwrong/templates/tree/main/luau-barebones)
          for a comprehensive prelude including Darklua string requires, Wally
          with types, and plenty of goodies.

      - For Roblox TypeScript projects:

        - Use the [`rbxts-barebones` template](https://github.com/prvdmwrong/templates/tree/main/rbxts-barebones)
          for a pre-configured barebones prelude.

        - Use the [`rbxts-comprehensive` template](https://github.com/prvdmwrong/templates/tree/main/luau-barebones)
          for a comprehensive prelude including ESLint and Prettier
          pre-configured.

## From Wally

For Luau projects synchronizing external files to Roblox Studio, Prvd 'M Wrong
can be installed as Wally packages under the `@prvdmwrong` scope.

1. Visit one of the desired packages:

      - [`@prvdmwrong/core`](https://wally.run/package/prvdmwrong/core)
      - [`@prvdmwrong/lifecycles`](https://wally.run/package/prvdmwrong/lifecycles)
      - [`@prvdmwrong/knit-compat`](https://wally.run/package/prvdmwrong/knit-compat)
      - [`@prvdmwrong/lumin-compat`](https://wally.run/package/prvdmwrong/lumin-compat)
      - [`@prvdmwrong/sapphire-compat`](https://wally.run/package/prvdmwrong/sapphire-compat)

2. Copy the metadata below "Install", and append it below your `[dependencies]`
     in your `wally.toml` configuration:

      ```TOML
      [dependencies]
      prvd = "prvdmwrong/core@0.2.0-dev.15"
      ```

3. Install your packages:

      ```Bash
      wally install
      ```

Now, Prvd 'M Wrong will be installed under the `Packages` directory, which can
be required:

```Luau
-- Tweak this depending on where the packages are
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local prvd = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.prvd)
```

If you'd want the linker modules to also export types, use the [Wally Package
Types](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/wally-package-types) tool:

```Bash
wally-package-types --sourcemap sourcemap.json Packages/
```

## From Pesde

For Luau projects synchronizing external files to Roblox Studio, Prvd 'M Wrong
can be installed as Pesde packages under the `@prvdmwrong` scope.

1. Visit the [Pesde registry](https://pesde.daimond113.com/) and search
   `prvdmwrong` to find a desired package.

2. Install the desired package:

    ```Bash
    pesde add prvdmwrong/lifecycles@0.2.0-dev.8
    ```

Now, Prvd 'M Wrong will be installed under the `packages` directory, which can
be required:

```Luau
-- Tweak this depending on where the packages are
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local prvd = require(ReplicatedStorage.packages.prvd)
```

## From Roblox

For projects exclusive to Roblox Studio, Prvd 'M Wrong can be installed as
Roblox models.

1. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/prvdmwrong/prvdmwrong/releases)
   to find a desired package.

2. Click the "Assets" dropdown to view the downloadable files:

      ![Releases](../assets/static/github-releases.png)

3. Click on the package you would like to import, which should end in `.rbxm`:

      ![Releases](../assets/static/github-releases-rbxm.png)

4. Open Roblox Studio to import the model. If you are just following the
    tutorials, just an empty baseplate will do.

5. Right-click on `ReplicatedStorage`, and select "Insert from File":

      ![Insert from File](../assets/static/insert-from-file.png)

Now, a new ModuleScript should appear under ReplicatedStorage, which can be
required:

```Luau
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local prvd = require(ReplicatedStorage["prvdmwrong-core"])
```

## From Node

For TypeScript projects that compile using Roblox TypeScript, Prvd 'M Wrong can
be installed as Node packages under the `@prvdmwrong` organization.

1. Visit the [`@prvdmwrong` NPM organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/prvdmwrong)
   to find a desired package.
2. Install the package through the preferred package manager:

    ```Bash
    # NPM
    npm i @prvdmwrong/core
    # PNPM
    pnpm i @prvdmwrong/core
    # Yarn
    yarn add @prvdmwrong/core
    ```

3. Roblox TypeScript does not include Prvd 'M Wrong in the project. Find
    `node_modules` in your project file, it may be nested behind several levels:

    ```JSON
    "node_modules": {
      "$className": "Folder",
      "@rbxts": {
        "$path": "node_modules/@rbxts"
      }
    }
    ```

    Append the `@prvdmwrong` scope below `@rbxts`:

    ```JSON
    "node_modules": {
      "$className": "Folder",
      "@rbxts": {
        "$path": "node_modules/@rbxts"
      },
      "@prvdmwrong": {
        "$path": "node_modules/@prvdmwrong"
      }
    }
    ```

4. Roblox TypeScript needs Prvd 'M Wrong to be included as a type root. Find
   `typeRoots` in your `tsconfig.json` file, it may be nested behind several
   levels:

      ```JSON
      "typeRoots": [
        "node_modules/@rbxts"
      ],
      ```

      Append `node_modules/@prvdmwrong` below `node_modules/@rbxts`:

      ```JSON
      "typeRoots": [
        "node_modules/@rbxts",
        "node_modules/@prvdmwrong"
      ],
      ```

Now, Prvd 'M Wrong can imported:

```TypeScript
import prvd from "@prvdmwrong/core"
```

## From Source

For synchronizing external files to Roblox Studio, or for developing the
framework itself, Prvd 'M Wrong can be built from source.

1. Visit the [releases" page](https://github.com/prvdmwrong/prvdmwrong/releases)
   to find a desired package.

2. Click the "Assets" dropdown to view the downloadable files:

    ![Releases](../assets/static/github-releases.png)

3. Under "Assets", download `Source code (zip)`. Inside is a copy of the Prvd 'M
    Wrong GitHub repository:

    ![Releases](../assets/static/github-releases-src.png)

4. Prvd 'M Wrong uses [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit) for tooling,
   which must be installed:

    ```Bash
    rokit install
    ```

5. Run the build script; when prompted, do not publish the packages:

    ```Bash
    lune run build
    ✔ Select packages to build, or none to build all packages · core
    ✔ Build .rbxm models? · yes
    ✔ Publish these packages to NPM and Wally? · no
    ```

Now, Prvd 'M Wrong distributables can be found under the `dist` directory, which
can be used however you please.

## Uninstalling Prvd 'M Wrong

Prvd 'M Wrong isn't for everyone. We'll miss you, but we want to make this an
easy breakup.

1. Replace every mention of `prvd(` or `prvd.new(` with `(`; if you use a
   formatter like [Stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua/), it will
   trim the remaining parentheses for you.
2. Replace Prvd 'M Wrong's startup logic with a vanilla implementation. A
   basic replacement might look like below:

    ```Luau
    local providersToLoad = script:GetChildren()
    local providers = {}

    for _, provider in providersToLoad do
      if not provider:IsA("ModuleScript") or not provider.Name:match("$Provider") then
        continue
      end

      table.insert(providers, require(provider))
    end

    for _, provider in providers do
      if typeof(provider.onInit) == "function" then
        provider:onInit()
      end
    end

    for _, provider in providers do
      if typeof(provider.onStart) == "function" then
        task.spawn(function()
          provider:onStart()
        end)
      end
    end
    ```
