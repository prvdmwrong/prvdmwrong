# API Reference

This section provides technical documentation about what Prvd 'M Wrong provides.
For an introduction to Prvd 'M Wrong,
[read the Learn section.](../learn/index.md)

## Type Signatures

Reference pages include type signatures describing the API member, for example:

```Luau
lifecycle(
    method: string
    onFire: (lifecycle: Lifecycle<Args...>, Args...) -> ()
): Lifecycle<Args...>
```

While these type signatures are written to be Luau-like, it is ultimately
psuedocode for developers. For accurate and syntactically valid type
information, see the source code.

!!! note "Note that documentation for TypeScript along with TypeScript typings
are planned."
