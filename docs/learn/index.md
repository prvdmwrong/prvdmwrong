# Learn Prvd 'M Wrong

Congratulations on choosing Prvd 'M Wrong, you’re finally making good decisions!

You will learn how to build great games with Prvd 'M Wrong, even if you never
used it before, with advice from maintainers who know Prvd 'M Wrong best.

!!! warning "But first, something important..."

    **<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
    DO NOT USE PRVD 'M WRONG. IT IS UNFINISHED.
    </span>**

    Prvd 'M Wrong is still under development. Unless you're really, really,
    **really, REALLY, <span style="font-size: 1rem;">REALLY</span>**
    willing and able to withstand large, sweeping changes, do not use Prvd 'M
    Wrong in production. Yes, that was five-reallys important.

    You will encounter:

    - missing or incomplete features
    - half-baked packages
    - changes in how things work between versions
    - updates that completely remove existing features
    - evolving recommendations on conventions and project structure

    This is not a bad thing! It means we can quickly abandon counterproductive
    ideas and features, and build a solid foundation for the future.

    Don't be discouraged though, feel free to follow along with our development
    and try using the framework in your own time.

    We hope you enjoy using Prvd 'M Wrong!

## Expectations

These tutorials assume:

- That you're comfortable with Roblox and the Luau scripting language.
  - These tutorials are not an introduction to Luau — If you'd like to learn,
    [see the Roblox creator documentation].
- That — if you're using Roblox TypeScript — you're comfortable with TypeScript.
  - These tutorials are not an introduction to TypeScript — If you'd like to
    learn, [see the Roblox TypeScript documentation] and
    [the TypeScript handbook].
  - These tutorials also assume you're familiar with Luau, which especially is
    important when troubleshooting bugs — If you'd like to learn,
    [see the Roblox creator documentation].

Some tutorials might challenge you more than others. Remember, Prvd 'M Wrong is
built with you in mind, but it may still take a bit of time to absorb some
concepts. Take your time and explore at your own pace.
