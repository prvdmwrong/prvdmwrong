# Prvd 'M Wrong Style Guide

TODO: Finish this

This style guide lists the coding conventions used in all Luau and TypeScript
code within the Prvd 'M Wrong monorepo.

It does not claim to be the best style guide, but it optimizes for consistency
rather than perfection, so we can get to work, and we do provide rationale for
many of the design decisions listed below.

This style guide draws from the following:

- [The Roblox Lua style guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/)
- [The LuaRocks style guide](https://github.com/luarocks/lua-style-guide)
- [evaera's Gist on clean code](https://gist.github.com/evaera/fee751d4e228dd262fe1174ba142a719)

## Principles

There's no one right answer to how to format code, but consistency is important,
so we agree to accept this one, somewhat arbitrary standard so we can spend more
time writing code and less time arguing about formatting details in the review.

The Prvd 'M Wrong monorepo needs to be minimal, concise, and understandable. Code
will be edited by several developers. Thus, ease of reading and understanding
code is of great concern. Complexity above basic levels is either justified or
removed.
