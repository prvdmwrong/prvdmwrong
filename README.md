# Prvd 'M Wrong

**Start Smarter, Not Harder**

Luau has often meant navigating sprawling mazes of dependencies, grappling with
incomplete frameworks, and a challenging development experience.

No longer. Prvd 'M Wrong is the Luau provider framework, freeing you from
logistical nightmares so you can focus just on your project's logic.

Use Prvd 'M Wrong to structure your project with providers. Prvd 'M Wrong
delivers type-safe APIs, method lifecycles, and dependency injection. Whether
you prefer batteries to be included, or want to use your favorite packages and
patterns, Prvd 'M Wrong adapts to your needs.

Built with fantastic user extensibility and runtime integration, Prvd 'M Wrong
can be dropped in for both new projects and existing frameworks. Prvd 'M Wrong
gleams anywhere Luau runs, from Roblox to Lune.

Zero bloat, complex tooling, or lock-in required.
